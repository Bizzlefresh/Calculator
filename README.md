# Calculator
This project is a simple calculator application that uses Python's Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The application can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application uses classes and objects to organize the code and implement the functionality of the calculator. The main class is Calculator, which contains the methods for creating the GUI, handling the user input, and performing the calculations. The Calculator class uses an instance of the StringVar class to store and display the expression and the result. The Calculator class also creates an instance of the Tk class, which represents the main window of the application. The application uses various widgets from the Tkinter module, such as Entry, Button, and Frame, to create the layout and appearance of the calculator. The application uses lambda functions to pass the arguments to the methods of the Calculator class when the buttons are clicked. The application uses the eval function to evaluate the expression and display the result in the entry field.
